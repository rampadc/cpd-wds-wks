#
# For specialised installations only:
# 
# By default, IBM Cloud Pak foundational services expects that the Db2U operator 
# (ibm-db2u-operator) is installed in the ibm-common-services project. 
# However, if you are using the specialized installation architecture 
# (where the IBM Cloud Pak foundational services operators and Cloud Pak for Data 
# operators are in separate OpenShift projects), you must edit the IBM Cloud Pak 
# foundational services operand registry to point to the project where the Cloud Pak 
# for Data operators are installed:
#
# `oc edit operandRegistry common-service --namespace ibm-common-services`
#
# Change the value of the namespace entry for the ibm-db2u-operator. Specify the 
# OpenShift project where the Cloud Pak for Data operators are installed, for example, 
# cpd-operators:
# 
#  - channel: v1.1
#     installPlanApproval: Automatic
#     name: ibm-db2u-operator
#     namespace: cpd-operators    # Specify the project where the Cloud Pak for Data operators are installed
#     packageName: db2u-operator
#     scope: public
#     sourceName: ibm-db2uoperator-catalog
#     sourceNamespace: openshift-marketplace
# 
# Required for:
# - data virt
# - db2 big sql
# - db2 warehouse
# - watson knowledge catalog
