# Attention: Automatically pulling the latest images from the IBM Entitled Registry 
# is not recommended for deployments where predictability and stability are important,
# such as production environments. This option is recommended only for short-term 
# installations, such as proof-of-concept deployments.
# If you choose to automatically pull the latest images from the IBM Entitled Registry,
# the software on your cluster could be updated at any time. This can be especially
# problematic if newer and incompatible versions of dependencies are automatically
# installed on your cluster.
